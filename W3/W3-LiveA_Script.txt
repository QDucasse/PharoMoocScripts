SCRIPT:
To explore the different possibilities of the System Browser, let's
look at the following important features: Show senders, show implementors.
Understanding how to use senders and implementors is important because it greatly
helps navigating and discovering how some parts of the system works.
Note that such practice is true in any OO languages.

Imagine that we have a message, a message with the same name is called somewhere
in the system but we have no idea if it is applied on the same object than the
one we inspected.

The implementors of will show all the methods in the system that have the same name as the one
inspected.

Senders allows one to show actual callers of the given method.
