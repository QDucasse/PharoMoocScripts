SCRIPT:
This video will show you how to restrict the search space using the Spotter
tool.

Looking for examples, you can type examples. Now if you know there is a pragma
in your example or that the methods you are looking for have a pragma tag, you
can use #prag.

Clicking on the grey arrow on the right side of the Spotter window, you can
explore all the methods that fit the research.

Using gtExample, press the blue arrow (dive in) to look into all the methods
that are named or contain "gtExample". Diving in again in the Pragmas category
will display all the methods that contain the gtExample pragma. From this point,
let's ask the Spotter only to display methods from morphs. You can see either
methods from the class Morph or methods that contain morph in their name and
that still answer all the above restrictions.
