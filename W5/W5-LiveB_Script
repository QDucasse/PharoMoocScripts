TOOLS USED:
Spotter

CODE USED:
./ #files

SCRIPT:

In this video we will look at how we can use Spotter to navigate through your
files.
Using ./ #files will display the content of the folder around your image. You
can look into the file if it provides a displayable content.
You can also visit directories using ./ #dir and inspect their contents. For
example, a png will be displayed on the side panel. You can even navigate
inside a zip file to see its contents.
