SCRIPT:
In this video we will look at how we can set up a repository on Github from the
Iceberg tool.

- First, let's create a repository on Github called MyPharoRepository.

- We will then go over to Pharo and Iceberg in order to clone the repository. The
first message sent by Icerberg will be that the project is not found. This is
because our repository is empty. Double-click and press repair to create the
project meta-data. It is good practice to create an src folder to save the source
code in.

- You can then do the first commit by going over the commit button.

- We can now create a dummy class and package:

[[[
Object subclass: #MyPharoClass
  ...
  package: 'MyPharoPackage'
]]]

- We can add this package to the repository by pressing the button Add package
in the working copy in Iceberg.

- Finally, you can press Push and look over the two commits. Once the push is
done, you can go back to Github and look at your package.
