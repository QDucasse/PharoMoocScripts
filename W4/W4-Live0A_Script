Iceberg tool.

PRECONDITIONS:
- You can push to a repository on Github

Here are the steps

Open Iceberg

Add from github

- Monticello Integration

I do not think that we need the following. 
Finally, we can add the remote in Pharo and commit to it. We can see back on
Github that our project is updated and can be looked into.
