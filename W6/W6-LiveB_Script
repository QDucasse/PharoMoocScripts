SCRIPT:

In this video we will look at how you can setup and customise your Pharo images
on startup.

Every new Pharo image that you create will go through the execution of a setup
file.

This setup can be found here:

System > Startup > Version Prefereces Folder > create startup.st


And consists of a succession of StartupActions. Each startup action will have a
name and a piece of code.

We will remove the logo using:

[[[
StartupPreferencesLoader default executeAtomicItems: {
	StartupAction
		name: 'Logo'
		code: [ PolymorphSystemSettings showDesktopLogo: false] .
}.
]]]
