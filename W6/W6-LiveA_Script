TOOLS USED:
Finder
Playground

CODE USED:

Morph new inspect

Date today inspect

(Point>>#degrees) inspect

SCRIPT:

In this video we will look at how we can define specific tabs from within an
object.

EXAMPLE 1
---------
In the Finder, let's look for a pragma containing gtInspector

>> gtInspectorPresentationOrder
>> Morph >> gtInspectorMorphIn

The Inspector on Morph is what you can see when you do

[[[Playground
Morph new inspect
]]]

This will open an inspector with a specific tab "Morph" when you can see the
aspect the Morph would have.

When looking back at gtInspectorMorphIn, you can see the different parts of the
tab.
> title, display and an error handling
> act to add some actions

EXAMPLE 2
---------
Pragmas > Date
gtInspectorToPreviewIn

We now have two tabs, "Details" and "Calendar" that propose a display of a
collection and a morph respectively.

EXAMPLE 3
---------
[[[Playground
(Point>>#degrees) inspect
]]]

We obtain a table of successive bytecodes in the "Raw" tab, look for the
source code in "Source" or look at the abstract syntax tree in "AST".

[[[Spotter
CompiledMethod>> gtInspectorSourceIn
]]]

You can look at the AST as well.


So you can look at how the tabs are defined for existing objects and even create
some for your own objects.
